# WinSurfer
A DOS-aesthetic file explorer/opener/viewer made in Python.

Requirements:
  You need Python to run this (duh)
  
  Libraries:\n
    ffpyplayer  4.3.5
    lxml        4.9.1
    mutagen     1.45.1
    Pillow      9.2.0
    pygame      2.1.2
    pymediainfo 5.1.0
    python-docx 0.8.11

Instructions:
  Just open WinSurfer.py.

BUG:
  DON'T CHANGE THE FONT IN THE TEXT EDITOR!
  If you do, the next time you open WinSurfer, it will display an error.
  To fix the error, delete the Data folder in the main directory, or just delete User_data.wsef in the Data folder.
  I AM WORKING ON THIS BUG!
